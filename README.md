# Ubuntu

This is the official library of ubuntu builds for Singularity images hosted on Singularity Hub. The following standard applies:

 - each `Singularity` file corresponds to a build
 - the builds are organized by folders, with one `Singularity` file per folder. This ensures that we can find the files programatically.
 - the different image tags correspond to these folders, and the name of the tag is specified on Singularity Hub
 

## Under Development
These images are currently not connected to Singularity Hub, but this will be done in early 2017. The first effort will be to develop a core set of images, and then any necessary builders / templating systems that would be necessary to help with this process.
